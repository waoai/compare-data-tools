# Compare Data Tools

You can use this project to [compare data tools online here](https://waoai.github.io/compare-data-tools/).

At [wao.ai](https://wao.ai), our users have dozens of data tools to make sure they have the perfect ground-truth dataset for their machine learning algorithms to train on.

We wanted to make it easier to sort through these tools for users, including screenshots and supported data types.
